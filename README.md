# Guillotine
![Gradle build](https://github.com/FaeCraft/Guillotine/workflows/Gradle%20build/badge.svg)

Guillotine adds a custom enchantment - predictably, named Guillotine.

* Level 1: 50% chance to make a player drop their head when killed
* Level 2: 100% chance to make a player drop their head when killed

This enchantment does not affect other entities - it only works with player heads.
